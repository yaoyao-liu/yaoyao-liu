Welcome to my GitHub. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/). My research lies at the intersection of **computer vision** and **machine learning** – with a special focus on building intelligent visual systems that are continual and data-efficient. If you have any questions on my projects, feel free to [send me an email](mailto:yaoyao.liu+github@mpi-inf.mpg.de).
